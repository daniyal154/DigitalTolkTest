What I like about the code.

1- I like that it uses the Repository Design And Pattern and uses BookingRepository as a dependency injected through the constructor.
2- The code is very neat and well-structured and really easy to understand.
3- The repository methods use eager loading (via with()) to reduce database queries when fetching related data.
4- The code uses helpers  to keep concerns like messaging, email, and job utility functions outside the controller.
5- I also like how it uses Laravel's Event system,promoting loose coupling between different parts of the application.
6- It uses logging which is very essential to keep track of everything.
7- Services like the mailer and SMS helper are called upon when needed, rather than cluttering the controller with these action.
8- Queries look really Optimized.
9- It separates user roles and responsibilities.

What I don't Like about the code.

1- There are no input validations in the methods.The incoming data should be validated.
2- I see the code uses hardcoded values directly from the env like env('ADMIN_ROLE_ID'). This can be moved to a configuration file or constants to avoid hard coding.
3- The controller directly returns a response. It would be better to have consistent error handling and success responses using a trait or any helper function.
4- Methods like getUsersJobs and store are called directly from the repository. A more descriptive method name for getAll could enhance clarity.
5- The role check logic $cuser->is('customer') could be improved by using constants or an enum for roles to avoid hard coding.
6- The logger is initialized within the constructor but is somewhat verbose. This should have been done in Laravel's Logging configuration or a separate  utility class for better re-usability.
7- There seems to be a duplication of logic when fetching jobs for different user types. This can be refactored to reduce redundancy.
8- External helpers (like TeHelper) and mailers are used but should be passed through the constructor via dependency injection to make the class easier to test and maintain.
9- There Should be try catch blocks in the code.
10- Instead of Isset and '' value checks we could have just used empty() function.



The BookingRepository can do with a lot of refactors but seeing it as a such big file i only did it in some functions.
